# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

For this week, the focus was on distributed tracing, which is a way of tracking application requests (HTTP, POST, GET, etc.) in order to collect data and have better observability and performance monitoring.

## Honeycomb

Honeycomb is one of the distributed tracing software that will be used in this project.

Honeycomb was set up within our application, and mock data was collected:

## Rollbar

Rollbar, another distributed tracing software, was implemented as well.

## XRay

AWS XRay, which is the in-house distributed tracing system for Amazon Web Services, was also implemented. Of the three, this was the most challenging to implement.

## CloudWatch Logs

We used CloudWatch Logs to monitor the traces sent from the application using XRay.
