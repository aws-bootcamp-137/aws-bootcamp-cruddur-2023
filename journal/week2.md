# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

For this week, the focus was on distributed tracing, which is a way of tracking application requests (HTTP, POST, GET, etc.) in order to collect data and have better observability and performance monitoring.

For setting it up within our application, the following steps were taken:

1. Add the following llibraries to requirements.txt

```
opentelemetry-api 
opentelemetry-sdk 
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http 
opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask 
opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests

```
